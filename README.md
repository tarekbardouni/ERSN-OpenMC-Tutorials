Here are a short videos that shows how to use ERSN-OpenMC-Py 
1. to install openmc.
>The following steps are described:
>    - update & upgrade the system & install requiered packages
>    - install miniconda3
>    - install prerequisites
>    - clone, compile and install openmc
>    - download & convert cross sections data from nndc
>    - run pincell model script
2. to create model of simple model of uranium sphere coated with graphite and immersed in water (eigenvalue mode)
3. to create model of 2D Lattice of 7x7 pincells (eigenvalue mode)
4. to create model of infinite sphere of water to calculate neutrons spectrum due to isotropic point source of monokinetic 2MeV neutrons (fixed source mode)
